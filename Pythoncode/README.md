# Software_Project.py (Help Desk IT system - Ticket System)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** The Software_Project.py file implements an IT ticket system using OOP principles. It defines classes like Ticket, User, and perhaps TicketManager to manage tickets.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is used to bundle data and methods related to tickets into a single unit (class), ensuring that ticket-related data and operations are organized and secure.
- **Abstraction:** Abstraction hides complex implementation details and exposes only necessary features of an object. In the ticket system, methods like create_ticket(), close_ticket(), and assign_ticket() are exposed while hiding internal workings.


# arithmetic.py (Sum and Subtract)
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** This file contains functions or methods to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction, fundamental in programming.
- **Function Definitions:** Functions encapsulate reusable blocks of code, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Data Types and Variables:** Understanding data types like integers and floats, and variables used to store and manipulate data, is essential for arithmetic operations.

# logicaloperations.py
- **Logical Operations:** This file involves evaluating expressions that return Boolean values (True or False). Common logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT are used for controlling program flow based on conditions.

# ticket_calactor.py
- **Input/Output Operations:** This file likely takes input from the user (e.g., number of tickets and prices) and produces output (total cost of tickets), fundamental for building interactive programs.
- **Error Handling:** Handling errors and edge cases (e.g., invalid input) gracefully ensures robust and reliable code.

# turtlestarter.py
- **Turtle Graphics:** This file utilizes the Turtle module to create graphics and drawings using a turtle metaphor. Understanding concepts like turtle movement, drawing shapes, and controlling the turtle's pen is essential.
- **Event Handling:** Event handling responds to user input (e.g., keyboard or mouse events) to control the turtle's behavior or trigger actions like drawing or moving.
